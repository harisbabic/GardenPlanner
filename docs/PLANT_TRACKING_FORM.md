## 1. Plant Information
**Purpose:** Records basic information about each plant, providing a reference for tracking its progress.

### Key Points:
- **Plant Name:** Enter the common name of the plant (e.g., Tomato, Rose).
- **Scientific Name:** Include the scientific name for accuracy (e.g., Solanum lycopersicum).
- **Date Planted:** Record the date the plant was planted.
- **Location:** Specify the location in the garden where the plant is growing.

## 2. Growth Metrics
**Purpose:** Tracks key growth indicators to monitor the plant’s development over time.

### Key Points:
- **Height:** Measure the plant’s height at regular intervals (e.g., weekly).
- **Width:** Record the width or spread of the plant as it grows.
- **Leaf Count:** Count the number of leaves, particularly for young plants.

## 3. Health Assessment
**Purpose:** Assesses the plant’s health, identifying any signs of disease, pest infestation, or nutrient deficiencies.

### Key Points:
- **General Health:** Rate the overall health of the plant (e.g., healthy, needs attention, critical).
- **Pests:** Note any signs of pest activity, including the type of pest if known.
- **Diseases:** Record any symptoms of disease, such as discolored leaves or wilting.

## 4. Maintenance Log
**Purpose:** Keeps a record of all maintenance activities performed on the plant.

### Key Points:
- **Watering:** Log the dates and amounts of watering.
- **Fertilization:** Record when and what type of fertilizer was applied.
- **Pruning:** Note any pruning or trimming done to the plant.

## 5. Harvest Record
**Purpose:** Documents the yield of the plant, including quantity and quality of the produce.

### Key Points:
- **Harvest Date:** Record the date of each harvest.
- **Quantity:** Note the amount of produce harvested (e.g., number of fruits, weight).
- **Quality:** Assess the quality of the harvest (e.g., size, color, taste).

## 6. Observations and Notes
**Purpose:** Provides space for any additional observations or notes that may be relevant to the plant’s care.

### Key Points:
- **Unusual Behavior:** Note any unusual growth patterns or behaviors.
- **Weather Impact:** Record any significant weather events that may have affected the plant.
- **General Observations:** Include any other observations that don’t fit into the other categories.
