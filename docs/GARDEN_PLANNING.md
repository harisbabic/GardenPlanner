# Garden Planning and Plant Groupings

## Overview

Effective garden planning involves understanding the relationships between plants and organizing them in a way that maximizes growth and minimizes pests. This document outlines strategies for grouping plants that work harmoniously together, optimizing garden layout for both aesthetic appeal and functional success.

## Companion Planting Strategy

Companion planting is the practice of planting different crops in proximity to each other for pest control, pollination, providing habitat for beneficial insects, maximizing use of space, and increasing crop productivity.

### Groupings by Function

#### 1. **Pest Control**
   - **Tomato + Basil**: Basil repels aphids, whiteflies, and tomato hornworms.
   - **Carrot + Onion**: Onions repel carrot flies and other common pests.
   - **Cabbage + Dill**: Dill attracts predatory wasps that target cabbage worms.

#### 2. **Nutrient Sharing**
   - **Beans + Corn**: Beans fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting nitrogen-hungry corn.
   - **Lettuce + Radish**: Radishes break up soil, allowing lettuce roots to penetrate more easily.

#### 3. **Space Efficiency**
   - **Corn + Squash**: Squash grows low and wide, shading the ground and reducing weeds, while corn grows tall, not competing for ground space.
   - **Strawberry + Spinach**: Both plants have shallow roots and grow well together without overcrowding.

## Planning by Garden Zones

### Zone 1: High Sunlight Area
   - **Plants**: Tomatoes, Peppers, Squash
   - **Characteristics**: These plants thrive in full sun and can tolerate high temperatures.

### Zone 2: Partial Shade Area
   - **Plants**: Lettuce, Spinach, Kale
   - **Characteristics**: These leafy greens prefer cooler, shadier conditions and can bolt in too much heat.

### Zone 3: Moisture-Rich Area
   - **Plants**: Cucumbers, Basil, Mint
   - **Characteristics**: These plants require more water and can thrive in areas with consistent moisture.

## Soil Preparation and Maintenance

### pH Adjustment
   - **Acidic Soil (pH < 6.0)**: Add lime to raise the pH.
   - **Alkaline Soil (pH > 7.5)**: Add sulfur or organic matter like pine needles to lower the pH.

### Mulching
   - **Benefits**: Mulch helps retain soil moisture, suppresses weeds, and can improve soil health as it decomposes.
   - **Recommended Mulches**: Straw for vegetable gardens, wood chips for perennial beds.

### Fertilization
   - **Compost**: Ideal for general soil health and slow nutrient release.
   - **Specific Fertilizers**: Use balanced NPK fertilizers for leafy greens, high phosphorus fertilizers for root vegetables, and high potassium fertilizers for fruits.

## Rotation and Successive Planting

### Crop Rotation
   - Rotate crops each season to prevent soil depletion and reduce the buildup of pests and diseases.
   - **Example Rotation**: 
     1. Year 1: Legumes (Beans, Peas)
     2. Year 2: Leafy Greens (Lettuce, Spinach)
     3. Year 3: Root Vegetables (Carrots, Beets)
     4. Year 4: Fruits (Tomatoes, Peppers)

### Successive Planting
   - Plant fast-growing crops like radishes or lettuce in the same space where slower-growing plants like tomatoes or peppers will later grow.
