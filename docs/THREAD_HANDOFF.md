# Thread Handoff

## Project Overview

The Garden Planner is a robust tool designed to assist with planning, tracking, and optimizing garden growth. The project is currently in development, focusing on implementing a secure, scalable architecture that adheres to the highest coding standards. This document is intended to quickly bring new threads up to speed and ensure a smooth transition.

## Current Status

- **Backend**: The API is set up with Express, connected to a PostgreSQL database. Basic models and controllers are in place for managing plants and tracking data.
- **Frontend**: A React-based UI is being developed to handle data input and visualization. The planting form is partially complete.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests are partially implemented. CI pipeline is set up with GitHub Actions.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete the PlantForm Component**: Finalize the form and connect it to the backend API.
2. **Enhance Security**: Implement JWT authentication and further secure database connections.
3. **Expand Testing**: Increase test coverage, particularly for API endpoints and form validation.
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new endpoints and revise the README with setup instructions.

## Handoff Protocol

1. **Review Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the project's architecture and current progress by reviewing the `README.md` and `docs/` directory.
2. **Access Credentials**: Secure access to environment variables and API keys through the teamâ€™s secret management tool. Never share these in public channels.
3. **Key Contacts**: 
   - **Project Lead**: [Name] - [Email]
   - **Backend Developer**: [Name] - [Email]
   - **Frontend Developer**: [Name] - [Email]
4. **Codebase Access**: Clone the repository from GitHub using the provided credentials. Ensure all dependencies are installed using `npm install`.
