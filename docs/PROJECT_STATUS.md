# Project Status

## Project Status Summary
The project is in its initial setup phase. We have established the basic project structure, including the modular architecture for both server and client sides.

## Current Focus
- Setting up the project structure
- Implementing the module loader system
- Creating initial documentation (README.md, DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md)

## Recent Changes
- Created basic project structure with modular architecture
- Implemented module loader for both server and client
- Established standardized handoff process
- Created initial project documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement the core module with basic functionality
2. Set up the database and ORM
3. Implement the user management module
4. Set up authentication system
5. Begin work on the plant management module

## Open Questions or Challenges
- Decide on the specific ORM to use for database interactions
- Determine the best approach for handling real-time updates (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events)
- Explore options for integrating with weather APIs
