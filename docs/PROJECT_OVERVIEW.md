# Garden Planner Project Overview

## Introduction

The Garden Planner project is a comprehensive tool designed to assist users in planning, tracking, and optimizing their gardening efforts. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing garden layouts, monitoring plant growth, and ensuring optimal growing conditions. The project is built using a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Objectives

- **Efficient Planning**: Enable users to plan their garden layouts with a focus on plant compatibility and pest control.
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Provide tools for detailed tracking of planting schedules, growth stages, soil conditions, and feeding times.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use integrated data on pH levels, planting times, and companion planting to guide users in making informed decisions.
- **Scalability**: Build a system that can handle multiple gardens, varied plant species, and extensive tracking over time.
- **Security**: Ensure that all user data is securely stored and handled, with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Garden Layout Designer**: A drag-and-drop interface for designing garden plots, taking into account plant spacing and compatibility.
- **Plant Tracking**: Forms for entering and updating data on individual plants, including growth stages, issues encountered, and actions taken.
- **Monthly Monitoring**: Tools for recording monthly observations, with automated reminders for tasks like feeding and pH testing.
- **Reference Tables**: Built-in tables for planting times, pH levels, and feeding schedules, tailored to specific plants and growing conditions.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphs and charts to visualize growth trends, soil health, and other key metrics.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for building an interactive, responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Express.js with Node.js, connected to a PostgreSQL database for robust data handling.
- **Testing**: Jest and Supertest for unit and integration testing.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring code quality and automated testing.
- **Security**: JWT for authentication, HTTPS for secure data transmission, and environment variables for sensitive configurations.

## Development Guidelines

- **Coding Standards**: Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to maintain code consistency.
- **Documentation**: Keep all code and features thoroughly documented using JSDoc and Markdown files. Update the `README.md` regularly to reflect the current state of the project.
- **Testing**: Implement test-driven development (TDD) where possible. Ensure high test coverage for all critical components.
- **Collaboration**: Use Git for version control, with a branching strategy that supports feature development, testing, and bug fixes.

## Strategic Analysis

- **Strengths**: The project’s well-structured architecture and clear documentation provide a solid foundation for future development. The use of modern technologies ensures scalability and maintainability.
- **Weaknesses**: Current limitations include the lack of extensive user testing and potential security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed before the production release.
- **Opportunities**: There is significant potential for integrating third-party APIs to enhance functionality, such as weather data for planting recommendations.
- **Threats**: Potential risks include scope creep, which could lead to delays, and the need to maintain up-to-date security practices to protect user data.

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Features**
   - Set up the project environment and repository.
   - Develop the basic garden layout designer and plant tracking forms.
   - Implement the backend API with database integration.

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Features and Security**
   - Integrate data visualization tools for tracking growth trends.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization.
   - Expand the database schema to support more complex tracking and analysis.

3. **Phase 3: Optimization and Deployment**
   - Optimize the frontend for performance and responsiveness.
   - Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
   - Deploy the application to a cloud service, ensuring scalability and reliability.
