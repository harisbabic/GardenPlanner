## 1. Coding Standards
**Purpose:** Establishes a set of rules and conventions for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.

### Key Points:
- **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js for backend, React for frontend).
- **Syntax:** Follow ECMAScript 6+ syntax and features.
- **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Naming Conventions:** Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and components, and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- **Comments:** Write meaningful comments explaining the purpose and functionality of complex code blocks.

## 2. Best Practices
**Purpose:** Encourages practices that improve code quality and reduce technical debt.

### Key Points:
- **DRY Principle:** Avoid code duplication by reusing components and functions.
- **Modularity:** Break down the application into small, manageable modules with single responsibilities.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent the application from crashing unexpectedly.
- **Security:** Follow best practices for securing the application, including input validation, sanitization, and the use of environment variables for sensitive data.

## 3. Development Process
**Purpose:** Outlines the workflow and methodologies to be followed during the development lifecycle.

### Key Points:
- **Agile Methodology:** Follow an iterative approach, delivering small, incremental updates.
- **Feature Branches:** Work on new features or bug fixes in separate branches named descriptively (e.g., `feature/add-plant-form`).
- **Commits:** Write clear and concise commit messages following the format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. Example: `feat(garden): add new plant form`.
- **Pull Requests:** Ensure all work is submitted through pull requests and undergoes code review before merging.

## 4. Testing Guidelines
**Purpose:** Ensures all code is thoroughly tested before deployment.

### Key Points:
- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all components and functions, aiming for at least 80% code coverage.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure different parts of the application work together as expected.
- **E2E Tests:** Write end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and verify the application's functionality.
- **Continuous Integration:** Use GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on every push or pull request.

## 5. Version Control
**Purpose:** Provides guidelines for using Git effectively in the project.

### Key Points:
- **Branch Naming:** Follow a consistent naming convention for branches (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`).
- **Commit Frequency:** Commit often with meaningful messages, ensuring each commit is a logical unit of work.
- **Rebasing vs. Merging:** Prefer rebasing to keep the commit history clean, but use merging for integrating feature branches into the main branch.

## 6. Code Review Process
**Purpose:** Establishes a structured approach to reviewing and approving code changes.

### Key Points:
- **Review Checklist:** Ensure the code adheres to the coding standards, is well-tested, and aligns with the project goals.
- **Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback, focusing on improvement rather than criticism.
- **Approval:** At least one other team member must approve the pull request before it can be merged into the main branch.
