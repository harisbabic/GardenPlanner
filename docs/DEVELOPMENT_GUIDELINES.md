# Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

The Garden Planner project is a comprehensive tool for planning and tracking garden growth, focusing on high standards of code quality, security, and maintainability. This document outlines the development guidelines to ensure consistency and quality across all aspects of the project.

## Coding Standards

- **Style Guide**: Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide. Use ESLint to enforce coding standards.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- **Code Reviews**: All code must be reviewed and approved before merging. Focus on code readability, adherence to guidelines, and potential optimizations.

## Security Guidelines

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information in `.env` files, which should never be committed to version control. Use `dotenv-safe` to ensure required variables are set.
- **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS for data transmission. Encrypt sensitive data at rest using industry-standard algorithms.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs server-side using a library like `Joi`. Sanitize data to prevent injection attacks.
- **Authentication**: Implement JWT for API authentication. Store tokens securely, and use short expiration times with refresh tokens.

## Testing Practices

- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for all functions using Jest. Aim for 90% code coverage.
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components using Supertest. Focus on API endpoints and data flow.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Adopt TDD principles where possible. Write tests before implementing new features.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: All tests must pass in the CI pipeline before code is merged. Set up automatic testing with GitHub Actions.

## Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Write clear, concise comments explaining complex logic. Use JSDoc for functions and methods.
- **README Files**: Each project should have a README with setup instructions, usage examples, and a brief project overview.
- **API Documentation**: Document all API endpoints using Swagger or Postman. Include sample requests and responses.
- **Architecture Docs**: Provide high-level architecture diagrams and descriptions in the `docs/` directory.

## CI/CD Workflow

- **Linting**: Run ESLint in the CI pipeline to enforce code quality standards.
- **Automated Testing**: Execute all tests in the CI pipeline before merging. Use Jest for unit tests and Supertest for integration tests.
- **Deployment**: Automate deployment to staging or production environments after successful CI runs. Use tools like Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
